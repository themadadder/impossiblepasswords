# impossiblepasswords
Password generator that I personally use now to make me some stupid passwords!

Pulls 3 out of 10,000 words from this link: https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000

It will then take the three words, add dashes between them instead of spaces, and then a random two digit number at the end.

TO DO:
- Add special symbols randomly to replace common letters (a => @, e => 3, i = 1, etc.)
